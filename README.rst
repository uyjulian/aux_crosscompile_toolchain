A/UX Crosscompile Toolchain
===========================

Modern cross compile toolchain for A/UX (Apple Unix) 3.1 with modern ELF Binutils and GCC.  

The difference from `Retro68 <https://github.com/autc04/Retro68>`_ is that it will run as a Unix process and not as a Mac process inside `startmac`.  

Still a work in progress; see `remaining work to do <https://github.com/uyjulian/aux_crosscompile_toolchain/issues/1>`_.
